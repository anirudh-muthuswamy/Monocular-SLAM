# Monocular SLAM

A lightweight monocular SLAM system that extracts ORB features, estimates camera motion, and reconstructs sparse 3D points. Future work includes pose graph optimization and loop closure detection.

## Features

- **Feature Extraction & Matching**

  - Extract ORB features and compute descriptors
  - Match features using KNN with Hamming distance
  - Filter outliers using Loweâ€™s ratio test and RANSAC

- **Camera Motion Estimation**

  - Compute fundamental matrix using the 8-point algorithm
  - Decompose fundamental matrix using SVD to obtain the essential matrix
  - Extract camera pose (rotation & translation) from the essential matrix

- **3D Reconstruction**

  - Triangulate feature points into 3D homogeneous coordinates
  - Visualize 2D feature tracks using OpenCV
  - Visualize 3D points and camera poses using VTK

- **Future Enhancements**

  - Implement pose graph optimization / bundle adjustment using GTSAM
  - Add loop closure detection using Bag of Words
